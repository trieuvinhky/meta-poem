# 📚 MetaPoem

MetaPoem leverages blockchain technology to build a flexible and transparent network for unstructured data and dynamic content. It creates a decentralized "verse" where information flows freely and securely — unconstrained by traditional intermediaries and verifiable on-chain.

## 🌐 Overview

MetaPoem is a Web3-native platform designed for creators, developers, and platforms that manage dynamic or unstructured data (e.g., social posts, real-time feeds, collaborative writing, etc.). Powered by smart contracts and oracles, it enables open, traceable, and immutable data flow.
